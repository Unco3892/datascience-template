"""Project-level configuration helpers for the Quarto template.

NOTE: This file is provided as an EXAMPLE for ADVANCED USERS ONLY.
Most students will NOT need to modify this file for their projects.

This module centralises environment configuration so users can adjust
Python imports, logging, plotting defaults, etc., in a single place.
It is automatically imported and executed during report rendering.

Common use cases for advanced users:
- Setting random seeds for reproducibility (numpy, random)
- Loading environment variables from .env files
- Configuring custom plotting styles (matplotlib rcParams)
- Setting up database connections or API credentials

Functions defined here are imported from `report/report.qmd` during the
setup chunk. Feel free to extend this file with project-specific
helpers if needed.
