# Introduction

## Project Goals
Describe the main goals of the project, including the motivation behind the research and the key questions you aim to answer.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Writing Tip: Make it Relevant

Connect your project to real-world actuarial or insurance problems. For example, if analyzing claim data, explain how your insights could improve risk assessment or pricing strategies.

## Research Question Quality

Good research questions are:

- **Specific**: Clearly defined and focused
- **Measurable**: Can be answered with data
- **Relevant**: Connected to the project goals
- **Feasible**: Can be addressed with available data and methods
:::

## Related Work

Discuss relevant academic papers, methodologies, and prior research that informed your project. Include both domain-specific literature (actuarial science, insurance, finance) and methodological references (statistical methods, data science techniques).

**Example structure:**

- **Domain literature**: Academic papers on your topic (e.g., claims analysis, mortality modeling, risk assessment)
- **Methodological references**: Statistical methods or data science techniques you applied
- **Course materials**: @azizi2025dsas provides Python-based data science techniques for actuarial applications
- **Technical resources**: Books like @mckinney2022python and @vanderplas2016python for implementation details

## Academic Citations Recommended

Your Related Work section can have **more value when including academic papers (further evidence)** from peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings, not just books or course materials. Use Google Scholar, university library databases, or specialized actuarial journals to find relevant papers.

**Recommended sources:**

- Academic journals (Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, ASTIN Bulletin, Journal of Risk and Insurance)
- Conference papers (actuarial conferences, data science symposiums)
- Working papers from researchers in your field

**Citation example**: "@azizi2022realestate investigated multi-modal approaches to real estate rental price prediction, demonstrating that models combining tabular data with visual information (property images and satellite imagery) outperform traditional methods relying solely on structured features. Their supervised learning framework fused dedicated neural network branches for each data type, achieving superior performance on 11,105 Swiss rental listings." *(This reference is already in your `references.bib` file and can be cited as `@azizi2022realestate`)*

## Citing Sources

Always cite your sources properly! In Quarto, use `@citation_key` syntax. The bibliography will be automatically generated from the `references.bib` file.

**Example**: `@azizi2025dsas` renders as: @azizi2025dsas

Add entries to `references.bib` in [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/) format for all sources you cite (every article normally generates BibTeX, otherwise search an online tool that does it).
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Avoiding Plagiarism

Make sure to cite all sources that informed your work, including:

- Datasets (with URLs)
- Methods or techniques from papers or tutorials
- Code snippets adapted from online resources
- Inspiration from existing analyses

When in doubt, cite it!

::: {.callout-caution}
## Common Mistake

Don't just list your research questions without context. Explain **why** each question matters and **how** it relates to your dataset and project goals.
